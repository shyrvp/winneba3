It is an intermittently closed lagoon with extreme seasonal hydrological and physical-chemical variation. From 1972 to 2014 the high water mark has shifted landwards with an average retreat rate of 0.22 m/year. Evidence of erosion and sediment washover indicate loss of and a shift landward of the sand barrier separating the lagoon from the ocean.A more open lagoon system stabilizes hydrological and physicochemical conditions, leading to increases in biodiversity and aquatic productivity. But on the other hand, urban development and waste water pollution as well as more and more agricultural land also threaten the sustainability of the lagoon and Winneba city. ');

The first troop to catch a live bushbuck from a game reserve used for this purpose and present it to the chiefs and people at a colorful durbar is declared winner and is highly regarded for bravery.[4] The bushbuck is sacrificed and this signifies the start of the Aboakyer festival.
